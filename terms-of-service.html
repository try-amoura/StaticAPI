    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: December 5, 2024</p>
    <p>
        Welcome to Amoura+! These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of our mobile application, Amoura+ (“App”), and any related services (collectively, the “Services”). By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Overview of Amoura Services</h2>
    <p>
        Amoura+ provides access to immersive audio experiences, including ASMR roleplays, relaxing audiobooks, and exclusive content. Some features of the App are available for free, while premium content requires a subscription to Amoura+ (“Subscription”).
    </p>

    <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
        You must be at least 17 years old to use Amoura+. By accessing or using the App, you represent and warrant that you meet this requirement.
    </p>

    <h2>3. Subscription and Billing</h2>
    <p>
        Amoura+ is a subscription-based service that offers access to premium content. Subscriptions are managed and billed through Apple’s App Store. By purchasing a subscription, you agree to the following:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Billing:</strong> Subscription fees will be charged to your Apple ID account at the time of purchase and automatically renew at the end of each billing cycle unless canceled. The standard subscription is priced at **$3.99 USD per month**, but it may vary depending on your country’s regional pricing as determined by Apple.</li>
        <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Your subscription will renew automatically unless auto-renewal is turned off at least 24 hours before the end of the current billing period.</li>
        <li><strong>Cancellation:</strong> You can manage or cancel your subscription through your device’s settings. For detailed instructions, visit <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202039" target="_blank">Apple’s Subscription Management Guide</a>.</li>

    </ul>

    <h2>4. Content Access</h2>
